# RSACipher written in java
-	The program will use RSA Algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data
-	The program will generate random public and private key pair.
-	Choose p and q bigger than 256bits.
-	n = p*q.
-	0(n) = (p-1)*(q-1).
-	Choose e so that gcd(e,0(n)) = 1.
-	Find d which is a multiplicative inverse of e mod 0(n)
-	Public key consists of e and n.
-	Private key consists of d and n.
-	Encryption will be done by c = m^e mod n, m<n
-	Decryption will be done by m = c^d mod n
